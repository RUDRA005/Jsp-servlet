The service() method is a method defined in the HttpServlet class, which is a subclass of the GenericServlet class. It is called by the servlet container to handle a request sent by the client.

The service() method determines the type of request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and dispatches it to the appropriate method for processing, either doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc.

Here's an example implementation of the service() method in a simple servlet:

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
   public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
      // Processing code for HTTP GET request
   }

   public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
      // Processing code for HTTP POST request
   }

   protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
      String method = request.getMethod();
      if (method.equals("GET")) {
         doGet(request, response);
      } else if (method.equals("POST")) {
         doPost(request, response);
      }
   }
}

Explaination :-
In this example, the service() method checks the value of the method variable, which is obtained from the HttpServletRequest object, to determine whether the request is a GET or POST request. If the request is a GET request, the doGet() method is called to process the request. If the request is a POST request, the doPost() method is called to process the request.
